    <h2>here is Everything You Need to Know About Stray Kids, the South Korean Boy Band Selling Out Tours Around the
        World</h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>how many members are in the stray kids?</p>
    <p> Kids is composed of eight members: Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, <br>Hyunjin,
        Han,
        Felix, Seungmin, and I.N. (There was originally a ninth member <br> of the group, Woojin, but he left Stray
        Kids
        in 2019 for undisclosed personal reasons.)</p>


    <p>How did Stray Kids get their start?</p>
    <p>Stray Kids has a very specific origin story: The group’s eight members were
        originally
        <br> brought together through a South Korean reality survival show, also called Stray Kids, <br> that aired
        in
        2017. It followed the band’s members as they attempted to rise through <br> the ranks of the now-saturated
        K-pop
        industry. They have come a long way since then; in <br> 2023, they won the Best K-Pop Award at the MTV Music
        Video Awards, propelled in part by <br> their avid fanbase, that goes by the name “Stay.”
    </p>



    <p>How many albums does Stray Kids have out?</p>
    <p>Stray Kids has released four studio albums (three Korean and one Japanese), four
        compilation albums, one reissue, 13 extended plays (10 Korean and three Japanese), two single albums, and
        thirty
        singles…all since officially forming a mere seven years ago. Generally, they are regarded as having a
        grungier,
        more rock-influenced sound than some of their K-Pop contemporaries.</p>
